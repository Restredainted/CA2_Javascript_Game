# 2D Game Engine - Javascript Game

# Introduction
For this project, my idea was to make a procedurally generated vertical column, comprised of a surface section where the player starts, containing a hut and well. 

The well is the interesting part of this as it's the entrance to the main gameplay area wherein the player can dig down, rummaging around and dig up buried treasure as gold or gems. For the purposes of this prototype only one kind of gem will exist with a 5x value over gold coins. 

# Core gameplay
The core of the gameplay will be the digging mechanic, the player will be able to dig in all the cardinal directions: up, down, left and right. this will enable the player to traverse and explore the depths they dig. 

The primary goal is to dig down deep and bring their treasure back up to the surface, so the player will need to think strategically in how they dig so they do not strand themselves in the depths. 


# Controls
W - look up
A - Move left
S - Look down
D - Move right
